<p>Since I'm just a poor MSc student I don't have any scientific publication to show you :'( <br>
<small>If you want you can take a look at some of the [projects](/research/) I developed during my master</small></p>

<h2>Bachelor's thesis</h2>
<h3> "DART mission to the Didymos binary system" </h3>
<h4 style="font-size:18px"><i>Summary:</i></h4>
<p style="font-size:11px"><i>The purpose of this thesis is to describe the DART mission to the Didymos binary asteroid system. To do this we start with a general description of asteroids and then move on to binary systems, important scientific
targets for studying the formation and evolution of asteroids and shedding light on the evolutionary aspects of the Solar System itself. The discussion will then shift to the modalities and purposes of the DART mission,
the first mission with the goal of testing a planetary defense system against potentially dangerous bodies. The system of (65803) Didymos, the target of the DART and Hera missions, will be discussed, discussing its dynamical,
morphological and spectroscopic characteristics. Finally, the first results produced by the observational campaigns, terrestrial and space-based, that began immediately after the probeâ€™s impact with the asteroid Dimorphos will be
described.</i></p>

<h3> "Exploring Rotational Properties and the Yarkovsky Effect in Asteroid Families: A Data-Driven Analysis"</h3>
<h4 style="font-size:18px"><i>Summary:</i></h4>
<p style="font-size:11px"><i>Asteroid rotation parameters are available for about 14,000 asteroids, from the ESA mission GAIA alone, with additional sources providing further data. A large fraction of these data remains largely unexploited, representing a unique opportunity for investigation. Specifically, I aim to analyze the rotational properties in relation to the family membership and the orbital drift associated to the Yarkovsky effect.
Particularly, I will focus on asteroid families with slightly different but closely spaced semi-major axes. These families often overlap in the space of osculating elements but can exhibit distinct rotational properties. By identifying and analyzing these differences, we can improve the classification and distinction of family members, enhancing our understanding of their evolutionary history and dynamical behavior. The analysis described above will be carried out through the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
ML is still an under-explored area of astrophysics research, and the goal is to develop knowledge and tools that can be applied in different contexts. Another goal will be to understand what possibilities and limitations ML has with respect to data and the topic I am going to cover.</i></p>
