      <h1> About me </h1>
	<p>I am an astronomer (astrophysicist) and currently a Master student in <a href='http://physicsofdata.dfa.unipd.it/'>Physics of Data</a> at University of Padova, with a strong interest in observational astrophysics, particularly focused on <b>minor bodies</b> and planetary astrophysics.</p>
	<p>My journey as a student (and aspiring researcher) is driven by a deep curiosity in harnessing the power of <b>machine learning</b> techniques in the field of astrophysics. In addition, I have a strong affinity for data science, which complements my analytical skills.</p>

	<p>My <a href="https://berto70.github.io/research">Bachelor's thesis</a> provided me with a unique opportunity to spend three nights at the <i>Asiago Observatory (INAF/OAPD)</i>. During this time, I had the privilege of observing the <b>Dydimos system</b> after the impact event with the DART probe.</p>

	<p>In addition to my academic journey, I have been actively involved in an <a href="https://berto70.github.io/outreach">outreach project</a> since high school, keeping me well-informed about the latest developments and discoveries in the world of astrophysics.</p>
